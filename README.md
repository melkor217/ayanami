## Wtf is this?

Modern web interface for hlstatsx DB, written in ruby.
My instance on http://beta.melkor217.tk is now probably available
for inspection.

## Roadmap

- Write less ugly looking replacement for hlstatsx web
    - Make it show a lot of data
    - Make it fancy
- Implement compatable MongoDB models
- Replace hlstatsx daemon with a cool new one

## Sad things

- CSGO is still the only game supported
- There is still no unit tests :(
